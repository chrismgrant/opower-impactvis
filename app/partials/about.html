		Hi! I'm Chris. I'm a designer specializing in product and user experience/interaction design. I studied information systems and human computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. One day, I left home for the Bay area and have been exploring ever since. I've worked in mobile social networking, wearables, the shared economy, and human-centered design consulting. I'm a big proponent of leaving things better than how you found them. I want to contribute to something that betters the world. I like to use my engineering background and other skills to augment my design vision. <br/> Lately, I've been exploring illustration, photography, and font creation.

		<blockquote>
			I was born and raised in Bergen County, New Jersey. I was first introduced to design around the time that I had entered high school. I was inspired by companies, like Twitter and Apple, that were using technology with meaningful design, to create innovative solutions and experiences for the problems around us. I used that inspiration to focus on the design and engineering quality of my high school projects. During this time, I would learn Photoshop and Illustrator through designing websites, poster, and graphics for school projects, organizations, and events. I had a keen and growing interest in entrepreneurship and would often create thumbnail sketches and storyboards of various ideas that I had for apps or improvements to my favorite apps. Throughout high school, my interest and skills in design grew with my technical education, all the while giving rise to an interest in human computer interaction. This interest further developed after learning about heuristic evaluation and hci methods at a Carnegie Mellon pre-college summer experience. 
			<br><br>
			The summer just before I left home for college, I had a very enriching experience working with designers from Nike, Converse, The Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum, and other established designers, such as <a href="http://cassetteplaya.com/"><u>Carri Munden (Cassette Playa)</u></a>, through the 2010 Nike World Basketball in NYC. That summer, I participated in a series of workshops offered by Cooper Hewitt that taught me various design skills, photography, and music production by creatives, such as <a href="http://theselby.com/"><u>Todd Selby (The Selby)</u></a> and <a href="http://djatrak.com/"><u>DJ A-Trak</u></a>. I also got to assist in the creation of festival components, such as <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/destroyer-france-jacket/pid-457503"><u>jackets for the French national basketball team</u></a>. That experience taught me more about traditional design and gave me my first real world exposure to the field. Ever since that summer, I strived for an interdisciplinary education through CMU's offerings in information systems, hci, computer science, psychology, and entrepreneurship to complement and expand my design interests. To grow as a designer, I would take on front-end and design roles for my course projects, internships, and hack-a-thons. I would also read about various design topics and work on my side projects. 
			<br><br>
			After interning for startups, in Palo Alto and SF, the summer before my senior year, I felt that I had grown substantially as a designer through working in innovative spaces, such as wearables, the local interest graph, the internet of things, and the shared economy. I was convinced that through real world experiences, working at companies that value design and unique experiences to solve interesting problems, I would reach my self-actualized goals as a designer.
